üí∏ Safe Bounty Fund is a secure way of paying hackers after a hackathon. Before the event, sponsors and organizers can use our dApp to add bounties. They do this by depositing funds in the smart contract and linking it to a Zupass badge idea for this bounty track. After the hackathon, the holders of Zupass winner badges are allowed to claim the corresponding bounties.
